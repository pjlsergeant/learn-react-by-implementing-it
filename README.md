# Learn React by Implementing It

## Why

I like to know how the tools I'm using work. I don't want to write another
counter app that doesn't do anything. The way that _I_ learn is by
understanding things well enough by being able to reason about them from
first principles.

This is a repository that gets you to implement React, with a view to having
a fundamental understanding of how the various pieces fit together. In each
file, you should delete the lines between `// <SOLUTION>` and
`// </SOLUTION>`, and try and implement it so that the tests pass. This is 
probably a terrible idea.

* createElement
- JSX
- dumb render
- useState
- useEffect
- better render
- `for`
